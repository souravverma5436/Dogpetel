RAILWAY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - FINAL FIX
========================================

PROBLEM FOUND:
The local .env file was being deployed to Railway and overriding
Railway's environment variables.

SOLUTION APPLIED:
1. Added .env files to .railwayignore
2. Improved debug endpoint to show more details
3. Pushed changes to GitHub

========================================
WHAT TO DO NOW:
========================================

STEP 1: WAIT FOR RAILWAY TO REDEPLOY (2-3 minutes)
   Railway is automatically redeploying with the fix.
   The .env file will no longer be deployed.

STEP 2: CHECK DEBUG ENDPOINT AGAIN
   Visit: https://web-production-463ec.up.railway.app/api/debug-env.php
   
   Now you should see:
   {
     "env_file_exists": false,  ← Should be FALSE now!
     "getenv_values": {
       "DB_HOST": "mysql.railway.internal",
       "DB_NAME": "railway",
       "DB_USER": "root",
       "DB_PASS": "***SET***",
       "ADMIN_PASSWORD": "***SET***"
     }
   }
   
   If "env_file_exists" is still TRUE, Railway hasn't finished deploying yet.
   Wait another minute and refresh.

STEP 3: RUN DATABASE SETUP
   Once the debug shows correct values, visit:
   https://web-production-463ec.up.railway.app/api/setup.php
   
   You should see:
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Database setup complete",
     "tables": 5
   }

STEP 4: TEST YOUR WEBSITE
   Visit: https://web-production-463ec.up.railway.app
   - Pricing page should show 33 packages
   - Contact form should work
   - Admin login should work (password: komal123)

========================================
WHAT WAS THE ISSUE?
========================================

Railway was copying the local server/.env file during deployment.
That file had:
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_NAME=petel_db

These values were overriding Railway's environment variables.

By adding .env to .railwayignore, Railway will no longer copy
the .env file, and will use the environment variables you set
in the Railway dashboard instead.

========================================
RAILWAY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (Already Set):
========================================

These should already be set in Railway dashboard:
- DB_HOST = mysql.railway.internal
- DB_NAME = railway
- DB_USER = root
- DB_PASS = bJAYXAWosDimtjepRwNXOGsaIXSCtKRmzZm
- ADMIN_PASSWORD = komal123

If they're not set, add them in Railway dashboard:
1. Click on "Dogpetel" service
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add each variable
