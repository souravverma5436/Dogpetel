PETEL - DATABASE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

✅ FIXED: Database connection issue resolved!

The problem was that the code was trying to connect to a specific database
that didn't exist yet. Now it connects to MySQL first, creates the database
if needed, then uses it.

========================================
WHAT TO DO NOW:
========================================

1. WAIT 2-3 MINUTES
   Railway is automatically redeploying with the fix.
   You can watch the progress in Railway dashboard.

2. VISIT THE SETUP URL
   Open this URL in your browser:
   https://web-production-463ec.up.railway.app/api/setup.php
   
   You should see a JSON response like:
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Database setup complete",
     "statements": 40,
     "tables": 5
   }

3. TEST YOUR WEBSITE
   - Visit: https://web-production-463ec.up.railway.app
   - Check Pricing page (should show 33 packages)
   - Try Contact form (should save to database)
   - Try Admin login (password: komal123)

========================================
IF SETUP URL SHOWS ERROR:
========================================

If you see an error, it might be because Railway is still deploying.
Wait another minute and refresh the page.

If error persists, check Railway logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on "Dogpetel" service
3. Click "Deploy Logs" tab
4. Look for any errors

========================================

- DB_NAME = railway
- DB_USER = root
